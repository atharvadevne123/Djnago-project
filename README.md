# 👥 Employee Management System API

A robust and scalable Django REST API designed for efficient management of organizational data including employees, departments, attendance records, and performance reviews. This project provides a clean and modular backend architecture that leverages Django’s powerful ORM, integrates PostgreSQL as the primary relational database, and follows best practices in API development using Django REST Framework.

The application includes secure authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), allowing protected access to sensitive endpoints. It also features flexible filtering, pagination, and sorting mechanisms to handle large datasets effectively.

To enhance developer experience and ensure seamless API testing and exploration, the project integrates Swagger (via drf-yasg) for auto-generated and interactive API documentation.

This API serves as a foundational backend for HR or employee management systems and is designed to be easily extendable for features like analytics, role-based access control, or integration with frontend dashboards.
